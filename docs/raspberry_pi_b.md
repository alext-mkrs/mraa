Raspberry Pi Model B
====================

The Raspberry Pi is based on the Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip,
which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor, VideoCore IV GPU
and was originally shipped with 256 megabytes of RAM, later 
upgraded (Model B & Model B+) to 512 MB.

Revision Support
----------------
Currently only rev 1 is supported.

Interface notes
---------------
**GPIO** Supported on pin 6,10,11,12,14,15,17,21

**PWM** Whilst the Raspberry Pi is meant to have 1 PWM channel this is currently not supported.

**I2C** The blacklist for the kernel module will need to be removed and the `i2c-dev` needs to be loaded.

**SPI** The blacklist for the kernel module needs to be removed and `spidev` loaded
